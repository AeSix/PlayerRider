# Language settings
########################################################################################################
#
# You can use Minecraft colors code in all those language parameters.
# As I've followed the essentials code notation in the plugin, you have to use the « & » symbol.
# Here is the codes you can use: https://wiki.ess3.net/mc/
#
# Usable placeholders:
# - {prefix} for the message prefix
# - {player} for the player who rides
# - {duck} for the player being riden
#
# Prefix used to all plugin messages (at least by default...)
# If you want a different prefix for messages (or no prefix), leave it blank « "" ».
# This value replace « {prefix} » in the next parameters. 
prefix: "&8[&7&lPlayerRider&8] "
# Message displayed when using the command /prider-reload
reload: "{prefix} &aConfiguration successfully reloaded."
# Error message when the chosen sound « boost_whip_sound » is incorrect.
sndErr: "{prefix} &cChosen sound is invalid and has been disabled."

# In the both 3 sections: (broadcast, player and duck)
# - sub-section "ride" is used when a player riders another
# - sub-section "eject" when he's being ejected 
#
# If you don't want one those messages, simply leave it blank « "" ».

broadcast:
  ride: "&f&l•&r {prefix}&6{player}&3 now rides &6{duck}&3!"
  eject: "&f&l•&r {prefix}&6{duck}&3 has ejected &6{player}&3!"

player:
  ride: "{prefix}&bYou are riding &e&l{duck}&b, yeah!!!"
  eject: "{prefix}&e&l{duck}&b's got a temper, try to give him a carrot maybe?"

duck:
  ride: "{prefix}&e&l{player}&b likes you so much, he now stands on your shoulder :)"
  eject: "{prefix}&bYou've just ejected &e&l{player}&b, beware... I'm sure he will try again!"
