PlayerRider is a very simple plugin for Bukkit (Minecraft server) which allows you to ride other players.

Dependencies:
-------------
NONE :)

Installation:
-------------
Simply copy the .jar into your Bukkit's "plugins" directory, then run the server.

Configuration:
-------------
The file plugins/PlayerRider/config.yml is created the first time you run the server, it contains a single option "message" where you can set which message will be displayed to all players when someone ride another player.

<player> designate the rider / <duck> the guy being ridden. To disable the message, put an empty (double) quotes pair.

Permissions:
-------------
- playerrider.ride: Can ride a player.
- playerrider.beridden: Can be ridden.

Usage:
------
Right click on a player to ride it. You can only ride a player if:
- You have the permission "playerrider.ride"
- This player has the permission "playerrider.beridden"
- You have no player(s) on your shoulders

To 

If you right click on a player who bears someone or on someone sitting on another player, you will appear on the top of them. So, you can make towers :) In that case, only the upper player can get down, the others have to wait being the upper one.
